## Predicting Borrower Default Risk

#### Summary
I have used Lending Club's loan-performance data set to study and predict borrower default risk. I engineer innovative features, build and compare models across a number of Machine-Learning methods including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines. I also discovered interesting insights about borrower default behavior which can be used by lenders to introduce new products and default reduction measures, and by borrowers to improve their creditworthiness.

#### Data
[Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/) has been facilitating peer-to-peer lending by bringing together lenders and borrowers since 2007. They maintain and share [loan performance data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) for all loans issued. Every quarter, loan repayment and status are updated, along with the borrower's credit score information. This provides a rich data set to study and predict borrower default risk.
